## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to apply recently learned HTML, CSS & JavaScript skills to create a memory match game.

## Game Instructions
The objective of the game is to find the corresponding match for the 8 'cards' in the deck.
For each turn, a player will:
- flip over an initial card
- flip over a second card
- matching cards will stay up
- non-matching cards will flip down after 0.5 seconds
